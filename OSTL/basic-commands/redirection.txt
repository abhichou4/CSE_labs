REDIRECTIONAL OPERATORS

There are three streams by default in languages like C, C++ and Java 
which can be altered by system defined variable (symbolic names)

1. > standard output operator
ls > filename.txt
cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt

2. < standart input oprator 
cat<file1.txt > file2.txt (cp command)

3. >> append operator 
command>>file

4. << document operator 
To take dat from the same file itself (referred to as here document)
Any file that can take satndart input can use here document to get data 

Example:

cat<<DELIMITER 
This is dumb.
