SHELL VARIABLES

Shell has local and environment varibale. When a child shell is made by using (sh) a copy of evironment varibales is given to them but not the local variables.
Thus, child shells only communicate through environment variables
('export' is used to make environment varibales) 

1. Creating/Assiging variables
   name=value

2. Reading from stdin
   read name 

3. Read-only variable 
   readonly name
