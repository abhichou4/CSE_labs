RUNNING JOBS IN THE BACKGROUND

Multi-tasking allows you to run jobs in the background. This can be done in two ways 

1. commandd &
PID is returned and the process runs in the background. But this process will be closed as soon as the parent shell is closed 

2. nohup command &
nohup (no hangup) allows running processes even after the shell has been closed.
The stdout of the command is sent to the file nohup.out

JOB CONTROL 

1. ps
2. kill 
3. sleep
4. wait
